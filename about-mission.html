      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        BUILD Beyond is a club of BUILD alumni in college, entrepreneurship, or workforce dedicated to igniting the power of youth in under-resourced communities. Our goal is to foster career success, entrepreneurial mindsets, and opportunities for academic and financial prosperity for alumni hailing from Greater Boston.

        The mission of BUILD Beyond is to strengthen BUILD Boston’s network of alumni and their friends through community exchange, storytelling, and networking with each other and BUILD stakeholders. This goal is realized through our shared belief in the transformative power of entrepreneurial education and student voice.
